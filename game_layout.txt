The game begins with text prompting you to enter your real name.

It is the year 1989
The government has received note of a hack-in at their ultra-secure servers, which contain very important, classified documents.
We have traced their signals back to a server owned by CAFE, a multinational corporation.
We trust you to hack into their system and completely delete the required files.
...
Good luck.

------------------

You will have to use a password cracker on a password-protected folder.
You will then gain access to a text file, stating that "If you are reading this, that means you've broken into my system."
It goes on to say what the documents that were hacked contains-
The documents are owned by the U.S. army, and it contains codes for a cutting-edge super-weapon.
It can wipe out entire countries with one press of a button.
The text file urges you to not go on, saying if "we" have the codes, the weapons will never be set off,
because of safety protocols that are installed in the program.

You continue forth, with another file in the folder containing a password.
This opens a zip file (you actually have to go into the game's files on your computer to extract the file)
This contains one of the documents. You can either choose to keep it for yourself, or destroy it.
In the zip file there is another text file that addresses you, the player. It explains to you
to go once more, further into your own computer, and seek the last document.

You find a zip file in the same directory C is in. You extract it, with a password.
