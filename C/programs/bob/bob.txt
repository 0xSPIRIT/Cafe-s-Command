B.O.B. is an artificial intelligence designed by CAFE in 1988.
The following documents the results of the A.I for each week.

Week 1:
    - BOB has just finished being implemented. The program is working as intended.
Week 2:
    - BOB has been documenting certain aspects of the conversion process. It is a very useful tool.
Week 3:
    - In our implementation of BOB, we programmed a self-learning system- we feed it information, and it learns.
    - BOB has uttered his first words into the console: "alive". This is very exciting.
Week 4:
    - BOB is speaking fluent English. We have conversations regularly.
    - BOB has mutated. The program now has senses.
Week 5: 
    - BOB is strangely silent.
Week 6:
    - Everyone disappeared. What is going on?
    - BOB is suddenly on all the computers.
Week 7:
