If you are reading this, that means you broke into my system.
Good job.
I know that you're here to destroy the documents.
First, let me explain...

I doubt you were told what was inside those documents.
They contain launch codes for a cutting-edge super weapon, developed by the U.S. Army.
They have unprecedented power.
If launched, they will wipe out an entire country from the map.

Now... if we have the codes, the super weapon will never be launched, due to safety measures installed
in the program that handles launching.
So, please. Leave the codes here, on this server.
Tell your employers that you couldn't recover the documents.

I hope you make the right choice, <Name> =)
